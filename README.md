You can install this module in various ways:

1) Download the **MagentoConnect Package** from our site and upload it into your own Magento
Downloader application.

2) Download the **Source Sackage** from our site, extract the files and upload the
files to your Magento root. Make sure to flush the Magento cache. Make sure to logout 
once you're done.

3) Use this **Repository Package**. Extract this entire repository to somewhere on your Magento server
and use `composer` or `modman` to install the Magento module. Alternatively, use this package to create
your own private repository.

Please note that this repository package is based on our own internal Yireo Git environment, but it
does not contain any versioning information.
