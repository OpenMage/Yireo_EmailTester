# Summary
Before going live with a Magento shop, you need to make sure all your Transactional Emails are functioning. The visual layout needs to be good. Spelling needs to be checked. All content needs to be double-checked.

For instance to test the order emails, the default procedure is to place a test order, complete the checkout and wait for the email to arrive in your inbox. When something is wrong with the email, you have to repeat the entire procedure. This is time consuming and very boring.

This is where our Yireo EmailTester extension comes in: It allows you to preview all  emails easily from within the Magento backend, or test-send them to the email account of your choice. No more lengthy procedures. Testing emails now has become peanuts!

# Magento 2 extension available
Please note that this extension is only available under Magento 1 (which is by now a deprecated platform that you should move away from). We have released a new extension for Magento 2, which is listed on our extensions page.
